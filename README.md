README File

Thanks for checking out my Neighborhood map!!  To get started, simply open up index.html in your browser.  Further instructions are below:

-Click the map marker once and the marker will bounce and display the infowindow.  To stop the marker from bouncing, click the marker a second time or wait for for timeout to stop marker bouncing.  To close the infowindow, click the x in the top right corner of the infowindow.

-To view the streetview of the coffee shop, click the 'Street View' link (opens in the same tab replacing the index.html page).  To return to the map, simply click the back button.

-To filter map locations and list of locations by star value, select a star rating from the select box--to return to the full listing click the browser page refresh button.

I hope you enjoyed exploring some of the Coffee Shops in Denver!!  Checkout my repository on github:
